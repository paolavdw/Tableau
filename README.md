The Citi Bike share system is one of the fastest-growing transportation networks in major U.S.
cities. It offers an excellent and accessible way to reduce carbon emissions while promoting fitness. This
analysis compares and contrasts data from February 2021 and February 2022 to identify any trends in
bike-share behavior during the morning and afternoon commutes.
# Map
The official city map was created using the coordinates of the starting and ending stations for February
allowing for a comparison between 2021 and 2022. On the map, marker colors and sizes represent the
total number of rides, with each marker labeled with the starting station, ride count, and month/year.
Demographic information is displayed through the map’s color scheme, showing the median household
income by zip code. A summary box is included to provide a quick overview of key statistics based on the
number of rides. Also, interactive filters allow users to adjust the data displayed based on the
starting/ending months, and starting/ending years.
In 2021, the most popular Citi Bike stations were concentrated in the 07302-zip code, where the median
income ranged from $81,000 to $250,000. A similar trend continued in 2022, with the addition of
stations in the neighboring 07030 zip code. However, what remained largely unchanged over both years
was that the least popular stations were located in the 07306-zip code, where the median income
ranged from $51,100 to $61,300.
# Visualizations
1. The first finding illustrated by “Phenomenon 1 “dashboard visualizes the significant decline in
the number of docked bikes, from 4,881 (3,951 members & 930 casual) in 2021 to 157 (0
members and 157 casual) in 2022. This decrease could be attributed to several factors, including
but not limited to the impact of COVID-19, varying weather conditions, and changes in Citi Bike
station availability.
The COVID-19 pandemic was first reported in January 2020, triggering a snowball effect
throughout the rest of the year. It led to widespread lockdowns, social distancing, remote work
and schooling, business closures, and the declaration of a national emergency. In the first
quarter of 2021, many of these restrictions remained in place, though there was a gradual
reopening of in person activities. All of these factors may have indirectly contributed to the
reduced usage of Citi Bikes, resulting in a higher number of docked bikes in 2021 compared to
2022. Additionally, in February 2021, a major snowstorm brought 18-24 inches of snow, which
likely had a direct impact on the reduced usage of Citi Bikes during that period. Lastly, Citi Bike
station availability may have been less accessible in 2021 compared to 2022, potentially due to
collateral effects of the pandemic. With social distancing and other restrictions more strictly
enforced in 2021, Citi Bike employees may have faced challenges in performing regular bike
maintenance. In contrast, 2022 saw fewer restrictions, allowing for more consistent upkeep,
station accessibility, and therefore, a greater number of rides. Interactive filters are included to
allow users to adjust the data displayed based on bike types, and starting/ending years, and
casual riders or members.
Visualization 1.b builds on the analysis from Visualization 1.a by comparing and contrasting the
percentage of trip durations and the average trip duration (in minutes) during the morning and
afternoon commutes. In 2021, the morning commute data showed that 84.94% of riders were
members, with an average trip duration of 19 minutes, while 15.05% were casual riders,
averaging 839.9 minutes per ride. In the afternoon, 79.49% of rides were by members, with an
average duration of 26.1 minutes, and 20.51% were casual riders, averaging 44.4 minutes per
ride.
In 2022, the analysis is further broken down by bike type: classic, docked, and electric. For the
morning commute on classic bikes, 51.86% of riders were members, averaging 14.6 minutes per
ride, and 10.58% were casual riders, averaging 30.2 minutes. For electric bikes, 26.54% of riders
were members, averaging 11.3 minutes, while 10.74% were casual riders, averaging 17.1
minutes. Casual riders accounted for 0.28% of docked bike usage, with an average duration of
253.3 minutes per ride. In the afternoon commute for classic bikes, 47.37% of rides were by
members, averaging 12.4 minutes per ride, and 14.37% were casual riders, averaging 29
minutes. For electric bikes, 24.10% of rides were by members, averaging 9.2 minutes, while
13.57% were casual riders, averaging 19.9 minutes. Casual riders made up 0.59% of docked bike
usage, with an average trip duration of 75.3 minutes. The following assessments could provide
deeper insights into the correlation between the percentage of trip durations and average trip
durations: behavioral trends, bike type preference, and ride efficiency. In 2021, all bikes used
during both the morning and afternoon commutes were docked, indicating a significant trend of
non-usage among members and casual riders, likely influenced by the indirect effects of COVID-
19 lockdown restrictions. In 2022, classic bikes accounted for the highest percentage of trip
durations and the longest average trip durations during both the morning and afternoon
commutes. Electric bikes ranked second in trip durations and third in average trip duration,
though they held the top spot for average trip duration during the morning commute. Docked
bikes showed consistently low trip duration compared to the other two types. One of the main
factors affecting these trends, as well as bike type preferences, could be the relatively recent
introduction of electric bikes to the Citi Bike program in 2022. Another key factor is the
efficiency of rides, where members consistently benefited over casual riders in both 2021 and
2022, with members accounting for at least 50% of bike usage (classic, electric, and docked).
Membership likely provides greater efficiency due to the numerous perks offered: unlimited 45-
minute rides, rewards, reduced e-bike rates, and more. These benefits incentivize users,
encouraging them to become long-term customers.
2. “Phenomenon 2” dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of the popularity of the three
different types of bikes (classic, electric, or docked) between members and casual riders. As
noted in Visualization 1.a, all 4,881 bikes in 2021 were docked. Of these, 3,951 were used by
members, and 930 by casual riders. Visualization 2.a highlights that, in zip codes 07306 and
07304, the number of docked bikes used by members and casual riders was more closely
aligned. However, a much larger gap in membership usage is observed in zip code 07302, which
also happens to be the most popular area for Citi Bike usage.
This phenomenon could be attributed to location and median household income. Zip codes
07306 and 07304 are geographically farther from New York City (a major employment hub) than
zip code 07302. This suggests that riders in the closer zip code (07302) may find Citi Bikes more
convenient and accessible as a primary mode of transportation. Additionally, the median
household incomes in zip codes 07306 and 07304 range from $41,300 to $61,300, while in
07302, it ranges from $81,000 to $250,000. These income disparities could indicate differences
in bike usage and accessibility. Wealthier zip codes may have more bikes available and a higher
affordability, contributing to disparities in Citi Bike usage across demographics.
A different pattern emerged in 2022, as the gap between the two types of memberships
(members and casual riders) narrowed compared to 2021. According to Visualization 1.a, the
23,499 total bike rides were divided as follows: members used classic bikes for 15,564 rides and
electric bikes for 7,935 rides, while casual riders used classic bikes for 4,208 rides and electric
bikes for 4,047 rides. Additionally, 157 rides were made on docked bikes. Classic bikes had the
highest usage and the largest gap between members and casual riders, compared to electric and
docked bikes.
One reason for the popularity of classic bikes could be the relatively recent introduction of
electric bikes to the Citi Bike program in 2022, with their usage growing in popularity over time.
The membership gap was more evident in popular zip codes compared to less popular ones. The
increase in membership rather than casual ridership may reflect an unexpected shift in bike-
share behavior due to COVID-19. Members were more likely to use Citi Bikes over public
transportation, such as the subway, in an effort to comply with social distancing. Additionally,
with people spending extended periods at home, cycling may have gained popularity as a
positive recreational activity that benefitted both physical and mental health. Interactive filters
are included to allow users to adjust the data displayed based on bike types, and starting/ending
years, and casual riders or members.
Visualization 2.b adds an extra layer of analysis to the second phenomenon highlighted in
Visualization 2.a by distinguishing between morning and afternoon commutes. In 2021, the top
five stations for both members and casual riders during the morning commute were
predominantly located in the 07302-zip code (a wealthier area). By 2022, three of the top five
stations for casual riders remained in the 07302-zip code, while for members, four of the top
five stations were located in 07302, indicating a strong preference for this area.
Regarding the afternoon commute, it was observed that in 2021, four of the top five stations for
members were located in the 07302-zip code. For casual riders, however, the top five stations
were evenly split between the 07302 and 07304 zip codes. In 2022, all top five stations for
members were located in 07302, while three of the top five stations for casual riders were also
in 07302. This data suggests that, regardless of the time of day—though afternoon hours are
particularly more popular—or rider type (members or casual riders), zip code 07302 remains the
most popular area for Citi Bike rides. Several factors likely contribute to this trend, including
social, economic, and environmental influences. The most significant socioeconomic factor is
likely the wealth of zip code 07302 compared to surrounding areas. Additionally, growing
environmental awareness, possibly driven by global climate change, may have encouraged more
people to use bikes as an eco-friendly transportation option.
# Strategic recommendations for city officials to integrate in the winter months:
1. A thorough evaluation of the Citi Bike program to plan to subsidy grants from a city and
state governments to minimize disparities due to socioeconomical demographics. This
recommendation has significant potential to create positive change in underprivileged
neighborhoods and increase membership in those areas. However, will this shift affect
membership levels in wealthier neighborhoods as well? Would there be a change in
behavior? Also, is the Citi Bike program ready for the potential high demand?
2. Citi Bike should consider offering a variety of incentives to both members and casual riders.
As more users prioritize eco-friendliness, the absence of incentives may lead them to
purchase their own bikes, especially given current economic inflation. Would discounted
programs encourage continued participation?
3. Real-time data should be accessible in the Citi Bike app, giving riders the latest updates on
bike availability and trail information. This feature could significantly reduce the time spent
searching for a bike and help riders find faster, less congested routes, potentially shortening
ride durations.
# Limitations of the data
The limitations of the Citi Bike data included, but were not limited to, a lack of detail on bike availability,
missing pricing information, excessively large data files that were difficult to process, and inconsistencies
in formatting among the CSV files. Addressing these issues would have facilitated a more comprehensive
analysis and enabled more tailored recommendations for improving the Citi Bike program
